[[vector addition, scalar multiplication]]

A vector space is an algebraic structure.
A vector space V over a field F is any set on which the two operations [[vector addition, scalar multiplication]] are defined in a way such that for each pair of elements x, y in V there is a unique element x+y


$$
\begin{align}
\forall x, y,z \in V(\\VS1:(x+y=y+x),\\
VS2:(x+y)+z = x+(y+z)


\end{align}
$$
