[[relation]]
sei R a relation on A
==> R$\subseteq$AxA

Reflexivity:$\forall$x$\in$A(xRx)
Symmetry: xRy$\implies$yRx
Transitivity:((x,y)$\in$C$\land$(y,z)$\in$C)$\implies$(x,z)$\in$C => (xCy$\land$yCz)$\implies$xCy
Antisymmetry:
Comparablity: $\forall$x,y$\in$A(x$\ne$y$\implies$((xCy$)\lor$(yCx)))=> no matter which two elements x,y of the set A either (x,y)$\in$C or (x,y)$\in$C
Nonreflexivity:$\neg$$\exists$x$\in$A((x,x)$\in$C)


R is a [[partial order]] on A iff it has the following properties:
reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric

R is a [[total order]] on A iff it has the following properties:
R is a partial order on A and additionally $\forall$x,y
