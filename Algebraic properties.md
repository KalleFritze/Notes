Sei there is a  set $\mathbb{R}$ of the real numbers
Sei there are two binary operations on R called addition and multiplication
Sei there is an order relation < on R such that the following properties hold:


$\forall$x,y,z$\in$ $\mathbb{R}$(
1) $\exists$!m $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$(x+m=x, m is called zero)
2) x+y = y+x
	xy = yx
3) $\exists$!m $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$(x+m=x, m is called zero)
4) $\forall$x$\in$$\mathbb{R}$($\exists$!y(x+y=0)
			(x$\ne$ 0$\implies$$\exists$!y$\in$$\mathbb{R}$(xy=1))
5)x(y+z)=(xy)+(xz)

mixed algebraic and order property
6)x>y  $\implies$ x+z>y+z
	x>y $\land$ z>0$\implies$xz>yz

order properties
7)the order relation < has the [[least upper bound property]]
8) x>y $\implies$ x+y >y+z
	x>y $\land$ z>0 $\implies$ xz >yz
	
Any set with two binary operations satisfying 1)-5) is called a [[field]]
If a field satisfies 6) it is called an ordered field.
Any set with an [[order relation]] satisfying 7) and 8) is called a [[linear continuum]]
